#Dice-gambler

Tutorial project whereby you and another player throw a dice, one at a time, and bank the number it lands on. You can roll the dice any number of consecutive times and each number rolled is added to your overall score. If you roll a 1, the points you have accumulated in your current turn are forfeited and it is the next players turn.

At any time during your turn, you may bank your accumulated score to add to your total score. Banking your score will switch to the next players turn. First player to 100 overall points wins.
